# Windows Ui Class Library

This Ui Class Library is based on CWnd in VC. I hope it can easy to define the Ui of Application by yourself.

## Plan

- [x] Font
- [x] Dialog  
- [x] Button  
- [x] Static  
- [ ] Edit  
- [ ] Checkbox  
- [ ] Radio  
- [ ] ComboBox  
- [ ] Slidebar  
- [ ] Table List  
- [ ] Tab Control   
- [ ] TrayIcon  
- [ ] Number Control  
- [ ] Hotkey  
- [ ] Curve Control  

## How to used

The Project must be adding all the Library source code, and include the "UiClass.h" in the "stdadx.h".
